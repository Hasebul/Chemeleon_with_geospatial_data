  "solution": "To calculate the start time, we need to consider the travel time between each location and the time spent at each location.\n\nThe total time spent at the Colosseum, Roman Forum, and Pantheon is 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 1 hour = 4.5 hours.\n\nGiven that we need to finish by 2:00 PM, we can work backward to find the start time.\n\nStarting at 2:00 PM and subtracting 4.5 hours, we get 9:30 AM.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider the travel time between locations. The travel time from Rome to the Colosseum is 17 minutes, from the Colosseum to the Roman Forum is 1 minute, and from the Roman Forum to the Pantheon is 16 minutes.\n\nAdding these travel times to the start time of 9:30 AM, we get:\n9:30 AM + 17 minutes (to the Colosseum) + 1 minute (to the Roman Forum) + 16 minutes (to the Pantheon) = 9:30 AM + 34 minutes = 10:04 AM\n\nSo, to finish by 2:00 PM or earlier, you should start at 10:04 AM.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.",
